# Moveo Project Back

I used nodeJS+express to run this application, I use a mongoDB as my backend and I deployed it on render
please note that I use free tier for the backend and it may have some down time so if you try to enter the website and you get an error please try again and be patientüòä

# Libraries I used
- express
- socket.io
- mongoose
- nodemon
- dotenv

## Run Locally
- clone the repository
- make sure you have a running mongoDB database that you can connect to
- in the .env file, change the value of mongoDB connection string to your connection string example: mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@cluster0.cmrjvzk.mongodb.net/
- you can use the sample data from the dev-data folder where you have codeBlocks.json file to upload the data
- run 'npm i' in terminal on project directory
- run npm dev
- then run the frontend. see how here ‚û°Ô∏è https://github.com/IdanDover/moveo-project
- enjoy üòÄ
